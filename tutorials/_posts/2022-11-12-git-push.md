### Abstract

TL;DR ? [Jump to solution](#solution)

I have seen countless times how (not only) junior developers trying to push their new branch with git CLI, typically it would look like this:
1. `git push`
2. Error occurs
3. Execute command from above error
4. Great job! You did it!

Error I described in second point 

```
fatal: The current branch <branch-name> has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream <origin> <branch-name>

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
```

Two questions comes to my mind each time I see this situation:
1. Do they just ignored fatal error without investigation?
2. Why do they waste time to bounce off each time?

Answer to first question is clearly: yes, solution to automatize this is listed below suggested command, answer to latter: I don't have any idea.

### Solution

You can easily enforce creation of new branch on your remote with a single command:

`git config --global --add --bool push.autoSetupRemote true`

It will affect all your repositories due to `--global` flag and add values directly into your `.gitconfig` file.
Described solution requires `push.default` be one of: `simple` (currently default push option), `upstream` or `current` option.
